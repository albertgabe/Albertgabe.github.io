I'd say this watch is pretty unexpected. A while ago I'm kinda hunting for a fair price Apple Watch since I'm a bit fed up with how limit you can do when pairing Mi Band 4 on iOS device, The reason is that I switched back to iOS a while ago because of the ecosystem, I deeply regret getting so many Apple devices. 100% sin. /s

*Cough* Anyway. The watch I get is an Apple Watch Series 3, 38mm Space Gray. It's such a bigger device compared to my Mi Band 4, even tho before I got it on hand, I'm a bit aware that it will be **too** small for me, but the size is actually perfect to me. It also got a lot more functionality than Mi Band 4, which is pretty sweet. The biggest feature I'm waiting to use is probably the ability to unlock Mac with Apple Watch, but since I haven't get my MacBook Pro and my Mac Pro doesn't have the Continuity/New AirDrop compatible Wi-Fi/BT card yet so can't use that feature. :(
But other than that. It's been exciting to use it as my daily watch. I will write a full review compare to my Mi Band 4 once I spend enough time with it and have the free time/motivation to write up. :)
